    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Xinyan Chen, born on Dec 31<sup>th</sup> 1988, from <abbr title="Guangzhou">GZ</abbr>, China.
            This is my first time in Canada, and I have a deep passion for art and literature. I am eager to embrace multiple cultures 
            and gain different perspectives through my studies at Algonquin College and life in Ottawa. As Canada is a culturally diverse
             country, I look forward to expanding my horizons and sharing creative ideas with classmates from various backgrounds.</p>
             
        <p>Before becoming a student of interactive media design, I worked as an interior designer, often inspired by creative works. 
             I am excited to learn and grow in this new field, exploring new possibilities in design. Through this experience,
             I hope to connect my previous design background with fresh expressions, just like  </p>
